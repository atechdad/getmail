Error messages

   getmail may output various diagnostic messages. The common ones and
   their meanings are given below.
   
  ImportError: getmail version 4 requires Python version 2.3.3 or later
  
   You tried to run getmail 4 with a version of Python prior to Python
   2.3.3. This is unsupported. If you cannot install a newer Python
   alongside your current version, please use getmail version 3, which
   supports Python 1.5.2 and later.
   
  Configuration error: ...
  
   getmail detected an error in your configuration. Check your getmail rc
   file(s). getmail will do its best to point out the exact cause of the
   error. Some of the specific errors it may find include the following.
   
    Configuration error: missing required configuration parameter name
    
   A class object in your getmail rc file requires the parameter name,
   but it was not found in the appropriate section of the file.
   
    Configuration error: configuration value name (value) not of required type
    type (why)
    
   The configuration parameter name must be of type type, but the
   supplied value value does not appear to be of that type. Further
   information may be present in why.
   
   The getmail documentation contains descriptions of the syntax for each
   parameter type.
   
    Configuration error: maildir path missing trailing /
    
   Maildir paths must start with dot or slash and end with a slash.
   
    Configuration error: not a maildir (path)
    
   The specified maildir path path does not appear to be a valid maildir.
   Check to ensure that it is a valid maildir, and that getmail has
   permission to write to it.
   
    Configuration error: not a mboxrd file (path)
    
   The specified mboxrd path path does not appear to be a valid mboxrd
   file. To avoid corrupting files in the event of a user typo, getmail
   will not deliver messages to files that do not appear to be valid
   mboxrd files.
   
    Configuration error: the fieldname header field does not record the
    envelope recipient address
    
   In a multidrop retriever configuration, you specified that the
   envelope recipient was recorded in a header field that getmail knows
   does not actually record that information.
   
    Configuration error: refuse to invoke external commands as root by default
    
   By default, getmail will not invoke external commands (in destinations
   or filters) when it is running with root privileges, for security
   reasons. See the documenation for possible solutions.
   
    Configuration error: no such command path
    
   An external command was specified as being located at path path, but
   the command executable was not found at that location.
   
    Configuration error: path not executable
    
   A specified external command at path path was found to not be an
   executable file.
   
    Configuration error: destination specifies section name section which does
    not exist
    
   A destination in the getmail rc file refers to another rc file section
   named section, but that section was not found in the file.
   
  Error: ...
  
   getmail detected an operational error. getmail will do its best to
   point out the exact cause of the error. Common causes are failures to
   connect to a remote mail server, timeouts during network operations,
   and other transient failures.
   
Unexpected Behaviour

   If getmail is behaving in a manner other that you expected, see the
   following sections.
   
  getmail uses the wrong hostname for my machine
  
   If getmail records a hostname other than the "right" one for your host
   (in its Received: trace header fields), check your /etc/hosts file and
   make sure the "right" name is the first hostname listed for any of the
   addresses of the machine.
