TODO
====

-documentation

-RPM package

-flush out getmailrc-example

-test, test, test

-do something about the #! line in the scripts?  env is an ugly hack I've
  never liked for this, but many people still have Python<=2.2 as "python",
  and I can't rely on /usr/bin/python2.3 or anything like that being
  present either.  "#!/usr/bin/env python2.3" will have to do for now.

DONE
====

-distutils setup script
-convert POP3-based classes to use the MixIn classes for
  SSL and non-SSL connections.
-fix every-other-message problem with delete
-break retrievers.py into smaller units
-Multidrop IMAP support
-make delete work with previously retrieved messages, and add delete_after
  (not tested yet)
-max_message_size

-max_messages_per_session
-make output cleaner when hitting max_messages_per_session
-message_log
-add "user" and "group" parameters to destinations (and maybe filters)
  that run in separate processes.
-add allow_root_commands
-allow command delivery in MultiSorter?
  -how to include arguments, replacements, etc. without having to parse
  a string into separate argv values?
