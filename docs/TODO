TODO
====

-documentation
-RPM package
-allow command delivery in MultiSorter?
  -how to include arguments, replacements, etc. without having to parse
  a string into separate argv values?
-flush out getmailrc-example
-test, test, test
-do something about the #! line in the scripts?  env is an ugly hack I've
  never liked for this, but many people still have Python<=2.2 as "python",
  and I can't rely on /usr/bin/python2.3 or anything like that being
  present either.  "#!/usr/bin/env python2.3" will have to do for now.
-break retrievers.py into smaller units?
-make delete work with previously retrieved messages, and add delete_after
-message_log
-Multidrop IMAP support

DONE
====

-distutils setup script
-convert POP3-based classes to use the MixIn classes for
  SSL and non-SSL connections.
