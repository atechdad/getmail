Version 4.0.0a12
21 June 2004

  -slight change to quit() to ensure old connections are closed
  and garbage-collected before trying to make new ones.  Thanks:  Frankye.
  -move default documentation directory to /usr/local/share/doc/ .
  -filters.py now checks that the filtered message is at least basically
  sane in that it has a header no shorter than the message it was supplied.
  Let me know if this causes problems.
  -add and document max_messages_per_session

Version 4.0.0a11
21 June 2004

  -add MultidropIMAPRetriever and MultidropIMAPSSLRetriever
  -add move_on_delete parameter to all IMAP retrievers.
  -add and document delete_after and max_message_size options
  -document read_all and delete options
  -rename pop3ssl.py
  -fix --quiet.  i.e., getmail should again operate truly silently if you
  want it to.
  -retrievers' quit() method wasn't getting called.  Fix.  Thanks: Frankye.

Version 4.0.0a10
19 June 2004

  -fix the retrieve-every-other-message bug when delete == True.
  -move base classes out of retrievers.py into _retrieverbases.py
  -fix exception when retrieving mail from an empty IMAP account

Version 4.0.0a9
19 June 2004

  -accidentally edited initialize() in the wrong class; it broke POP3.
  This update should fix it.

Version 4.0.0a8
18 June 2004

  -fix 6 instances of getmailConfirurationError typo in retrievers.py
  -finish basics of IMAP support -- i.e., it successfully retrieves mail.
  delete might not work yet.  IMAP-over-SSL /might/, but the server I was
  testing against wasn't working with SSL (no connection).
  -handle email.Utils.getaddresses returning None.  Thanks:  Frankye.
  -fix default port for MultidropPOP3SSLRetriever.

Version 4.0.0a7
17 June 2004

  -debug and rewrite POP3-over-SSL functionality.  Involved writing around
  some ugly limitations and kludges in Python's socket.ssl and poplib.POP3
  code.  But POP3-over-SSL actually works now, and is fairly clean.
  Let me know if it hangs; I might need to change the way blocking mode is
  handled on the underlying socket.

Version 4.0.0a6
16 June 2004

  -add pseudofile class to implement readline() and sslwrapper to implement
  sendall() on ssl objects.  
  ssl objects in Python don't behave like a file, or like a socket; they're just 
  ... broken. It's a deficiency in the Python standard library.
  This might make POP3-over-SSL work, or it might need more work yet.  I've
  got it talking some SSL, but it hangs at the moment.  Might be blocking
  in read().
  -move Mboxrd file locking to _deliver_message().  Thanks:  Frankye.
  -make --trace more useful and add extra debug info to main script.
  -eliminate noise from defaults in non-[options] section processing
  -found Python's ConfigParser .getboolean() method failed when the passed-in
  default was a non-string.  Maybe I should have stayed with my own
  replacement configuration parser, as it properly handled this case ...
  submitted a patch to the Python bug tracker and added a workaround to
  getmail for the moment.
  -/really/ enable delete and read_all in [options] of rc file.

Version 4.0.0a5
16 June 2004

  -document tuple syntax.  Thanks:  Frankye.
  -fix "filters" name collision in script.  Thanks:  Frankye.

Version 4.0.0a4
15 June 2004

  -fix default values in three classes' parameters which previously relied
  on type conversion.  Thanks: Andrew Raines.
  -fix default port for POP3-over-SSL and "username" parameter in documentation.
  Thanks: Frankye.
  -enable delete and read_all in [options] of rc file.  Change handling of
  verbose.

Version 4.0.0a3
15 June 2004

  -fix typo in processing filters.  Thanks: K. Shantanu.
  -fix typo in processing non-default parameters.  Thanks: Andrew Raines. 
  -document SSL retrievers
  -move retrievers.py configuration functionality into ConfigurableBase class
  -convert filters.py to use ConfigurableBase
  -convert destinations.py to use ConfigurableBase

Version 4.0.0a2
14 June 2004

  -fix default/'default' in filters module.  Thanks: Andrew Raines. 
  -add the mix-in classes for SSL support with POP3 classes.  Meant small
  rewrites to the POP3 classes, but the design should be even cleaner now.

Version 4.0.0a1
14 June 2004

  -first alpha release of getmail version 4


Changes since getmail version 3
-------------------------------

-complete rewrite
-switch to Python version 2.3.3:
  -increased code readability (augmented assignment, list comprehensions,
    string methods, etc)
  -eliminate external modules (ConfParser, timeoutsocket)
  -use standard library modules which have come up to reasonable levels
    of quality and functionality over old custom code (optparse,
    ConfigParser)
  -no longer require workarounds for older, broken standard library modules/
    functions
-modular, object-oriented framework for retrievers, destinations allows
  extensibility
-make more platform-agnostic (transparently support system EOL convention,
  etc)
-support for multiple retriever/account types:
  -POP (simple, multidrop, SPDS)
  -IMAPv4 (incomplete)
-configuration (rc) file format changes:
  -support multiple rc files per invocation
  -one retriever, one destination per file
