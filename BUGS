Known bugs in getmail:
======================

  -No known bugs.

If you find a bug in getmail, please email a description of the bug, any error 
message which getmail printed, and the result of running getmail with your 
normal options plus '--dump' to either the getmail mailing list <getmail @ 
discworld.dnsalias.org> (subscribers only), or to me privately at <getmail @ 
discworld.dyndns.org>.

Note that if you send your report to me privately, and it does not actually 
appear to be a bug in getmail (i.e. it's a usage error, or you asked for 
technical support), I probably won't reply -- I simply do not have time to 
answer everyone's questions in private.

If you have a support question you want answered for free, it belongs on the 
mailing list (after reading the documentation and searching the list archives).  
If you're willing to pay my consulting rates, then I can provide private 
technical support.
