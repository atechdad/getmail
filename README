This is an alpha-testing release of getmail version 4.

See docs/COPYING for copyright and distribution information.  In short:  please

See docs/docs.html or docs/docs.txt for details on setting up and using getmail.  
This documentation is incomplete.

getmail version 4 requires Python version 2.3.3 or later.  You can have
several installed versions of Python peacefully co-existing, see
python.org for details.

See docs/BUGS for how to report bugs.

To install:  getmail v.4 uses the standard Python distutils.  Do the following
  as a regular user:

    python setup.py build

  Then (probably as root), do:

    python setup.py install

  This will install the Python files under the site-packages directory of your
  Python installation (typically /usr/local/lib/pythonXXX or
  /usr/lib/pythonXXX), and the documentation under 
  /usr/local/share/doc/getmail-4/ .

  You can specify an alternate directory to install under with
  --prefix=<path>, like:

    python setup.py install --prefix=/package/misc/host/localhost/getmail-VERSION/

The three scripts included in the package (getmail, getmail_maildir, and
getmail_mbox) will have their "#!"-interpreter line automatically modified 
to invoke the Python interpreter you run the setup script with.  If you later
remove this version of Python, and the newer version does not provide a link
to the interpreter with that name, you may have to modify the scripts.
