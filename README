getmail version 4 requires Python version 2.3.3 or later.  You can have
several installed versions of Python peacefully co-existing, see
python.org for details.

To install:  getmail v.4 uses the standard Python distutils.  Do the following
  as a regular user:

    python setup.py build

  Then (probably as root), do:

    python setup.py install

  This will install the software as follows:

    -the three scripts will be installed in /usr/local/bin/
    -the Python files will be installed under the site-packages directory of
     your Python installation (typically /usr/local/lib/pythonXXX or
     /usr/lib/pythonXXX)
    -the documentation will be installed under /usr/local/doc/getmail-<version>/
    -the man pages will be installed under /usr/local/man/

  You can specify an alternate directory to install under with
  --prefix=<path>, like:

    python setup.py install --prefix=/package/misc/host/localhost/getmail-VERSION/

The three scripts included in the package (getmail, getmail_maildir, and
getmail_mbox) will have their "#!"-interpreter line automatically modified
to invoke the Python interpreter you run the setup script with.  If you later
remove this version of Python, and the newer version does not provide a link
to the interpreter with that name, you may have to modify the scripts.
