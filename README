This is an alpha-testing release of getmail version 4.

See docs/COPYING for copyright and distribution information.  In short:  please
don't distribute this software in its alpha stages.

See docs/documentation.txt for details on setting up and using getmail.  Real
documentation is yet to be written.

See docs/BUGS for how to report bugs.

To install:  getmail v.4 uses the standard Python distutils.  Do the following
  as a regular user:

    python setup.py build

  Then (probably as root), do:

    python setup.py install

  This will install the Python files under the site-packages directory of your
  Python installation (typically /usr/local/lib/pythonXXX or
  /usr/lib/pythonXXX), and the documentation under /usr/local/doc/getmail-4/.

getmail version 4 requires Python version 2.3.3 or later.
