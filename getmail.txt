       servers.
     * Support for multidrop or domain mailboxes.
     * Safe  and  reliable  delivery  to qmail-style Maildirs, as well as
       program  (pipe)  delivery  for  use  with arbitrary external MDAs.

       fcntl-type flock locking.
     * Does not destroy information by rewriting mail headers.
     * Does  not  cause mail loops by doing SMTP injection, and therefore
       does  not  require that you run an MTA (like qmail or sendmail) on
       your host.
     * Can  remember  which mail it has already retrieved, and can be set
       to only download new messages.
     * Written in Python, and therefore easy to extend or customize.
     * Simple to install, configure, and use.
     * Won DaveCentral's "Best of Linux" award on 13 January 2000.

getmail Requirements

     * Python version 1.5.2 or higher.
     * A  configuration/data  directory.  By default, getmail looks for a
       directory named ".getmail" in your home directory. You can specify
       an alternative location with the --getmaildir or -g option.
     * getmail  must  have  write  permission  to  the  Maildirs  you are
       delivering to. This can be done by making the various destinations
       group  writable,  by  only delivering to destinations owned by the
       user  getmail  is  running as, or by running getmail as root. When
       delivering to Maildirs, getmail will attempt to chown any files it
       creates to the owner of the Maildir.
